    An analogy: The app we are creating will exist on only 1 device (and we don't need it to work on multiple devices).
    We can imagine it as being installed on a single self-service kiosk in a ticket booking office.
    In the beginning, there are no events and no accounts on the system.
    First, entertainment providers come to the kiosk, register for accounts, and manually enter details to create new
    events.
    Consumers can then come in, register at the kiosk, and make bookings.
    To cancel an event, the entertainment providers have to come in again, login to the kiosk and use it to cancel their
    event.

<p>This documentation will help to guide your design. To better understand how this project is structured, you may want
    to read about the
    <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command">Command</a>,
    <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state">State</a>, and
    <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method">Factory Method</a> design patterns, as well as the
    <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/application-design-with-mvc.html">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</a> architecture pattern first.

<p>The diagram on the left illustrates the package and class structure of the whole project - the coloured boxes are the
    packages,
    which have classes and enumerations within. The diagram on the right is a less pretty class diagram, but it contains
    all the fields, methods, and dependency arrows.
    These will be too small to see no matter how big your screen is, but if you right-click and choose "Open image in
    new tab", the full size variants should open.</p>

<p>The documentation links below explain in detail what each of the classes do, but you probably don't need to know all of it.
    See the coursework instructions for your specific tasks. Good luck!</p>
